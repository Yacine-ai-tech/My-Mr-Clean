# Welcome to My M And A

## Task
The main objective of this project is to develop a tool that can efficiently process CSV data and convert it into a structured SQL database. 
The challenge lies in ensuring the CSV data is accurately parsed and stored while maintaining the integrity and structure of the data

## Description
To solve the problem, we have created a Python script that reads CSV content, processes it, and inserts it into a SQLite database.
 This involves reading the CSV file, parsing the data into a pandas DataFrame, and then writing this DataFrame into a SQLite table.
  The solution ensures that the CSV headers are properly handled and that the data is accurately stored in the database.


## Installation
run the following lines of code:
merged_csv = my_m_and_a(content_database_1, content_database_2, content_database_3) 
my_ds_babel.csv_to_sql(merged_csv, 'plastic_free_boutique.sql', 'customers')

## Usage
This project cleans data and converts to sql format
