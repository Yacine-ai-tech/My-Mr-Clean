# Welcome to My Linear Regression
Welcome to My Linear Regression

## Task
The task of this project is to perform linear regression using the least squares method and gradient descent optimization.
 The challenge lies in understanding and implementing both algorithms effectively.

## Description
This project implements linear regression using the least squares method and gradient descent optimization.
 It starts by generating random data for linear regression, then fits a model using the least squares method. It also includes visualization of the original data points and the regression line.
 Additionally, it implements gradient descent optimization to find the minimum of a given function and visualizes the optimization path on the function's surface in 3D.

## Installation
There is no specific installation required for this project. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Usage
python linear_regression.py
