# Welcome to My Open The Iris

## Task
The objective of this project is to analyze the Iris dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The challenge is to build models that accurately classify the Iris flower species based on the given features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

## Description
The problem is solved by implementing a machine learning pipeline that includes loading the dataset, summarizing the data, visualizing the data through univariate and multivariate plots, and evaluating the performance of several machine learning models. The models used are Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Classifier. These models are evaluated using cross-validation to ensure reliable accuracy estimates.

## Installation

To install and run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
## Usage
After installing the required libraries, you can run the script to see the data analysis and model evaluation results.
